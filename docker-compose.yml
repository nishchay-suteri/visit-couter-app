# what are all the images it needs to build and run in containers
# services ~ containers
services:
  redis-server: # name of the service.. any name
    image: "redis" # use "redis" image from Dockerhub
  node-app:
    restart: on-failure
    # restart: <policy>
    # <policy>: "no": Never attempt to restart(default policy), always: if container stops "for any reason", on-failure: if container stops with an erro code(code other that 0.. 0 means OK)
    # policy "no" is in quotes since no in yml file is a keyword considered as false. But we want to specify policy as string.
    build: . # use the dockerfile in current directory to build
    ports: # which ports we want to expose
      - "8081:8081" # <local_machine_port>:<container_port>
# NOTE: defining the containers like above inside docker-compose.yml, docker compose will automatically connect these two containers
